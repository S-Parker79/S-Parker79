- 👋 Hi, I’m @S-Parker79
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, and Software Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blue Team toolkits and more in-depth Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything usable.
- 📫 How to reach me? Throw a penny into the well and make a wish, or you can message me here.
- This is a new Github as my old one magically disappeared.
